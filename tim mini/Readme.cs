     **********************
     ADVANCED CONFIGURATION

     The settings below may be changed if you like, but read the notes and remember
     that any changes will be reverted when you update the script from the workshop.
     

         Each "Type/" section can have multiple "/Subtype"s, which are formatted like
         "/Subtype,MinQta,PctQta,Label,Blueprint". Label and Blueprint specified only
         if different from Subtype, but Ingot and Ore have no Blueprint. Quota values
         are based on material requirements for various blueprints (some built in to
         the game, some from the community workshop).
