# TIM-mini
a mini version of tim

This is just updated and fixed version of Taleden's inventory manager https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=546825757

I didnt write the original code, I just updated it to work with the most recent version of space engineers, and minified it using https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE
